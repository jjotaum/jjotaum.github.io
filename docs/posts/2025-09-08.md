# About Chroma 2.0

## A brief context

Chroma was the first app I released to the AppStore more than a year ago, since first version It has been constantly evolving to be a better product and try to be as accurate as posible to the vision behind it.

Being my first standalone app, it has taught me a lot about the whole process behind product development and now that a next major release is coming I think it's time to take all the learning behind it into account to take it to the next level and be a more robust, performant and usable product.

## Current state

I took the time to identify the current state of the product, its strengths and weaknesses, and defined a new roadmap for it's next major release with improvements not only in the technical and performance aspects as expected, but also reconsidering many decisions related to the user experience.

If you're a regular user of the app, I'd like to thank you  for supporting all the effort I've been putting into Chroma all this time and let you know that the app will be receiving exciting updates in the coming weeks.

## Upcoming features

I won't go into details about all the upcoming changes here, but I'll try to mention a couple that I think will be very important for all Chroma users, off course there will be surprises.


- App UI/UX overhaul, including several improvements on how app looks & behave today.
- Support for collections, a long-awaited feature.
- Add support to import/export palettes and colors to new formats, improve stability and compatibility of currently supported formats.
- Core logic to fetch Palettes & Colors will be rewritten from scratch (performance boost).
