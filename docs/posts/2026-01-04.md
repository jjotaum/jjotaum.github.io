# 2025 Wrapped!

## Introduction

I know, I know—it’s already 2026 by a couple of days, but I still wanted to write something a bit silly about how my year as a developer went overall. This year, I learned a lot, traveled, and enjoyed time with the people I love, so I really can’t complain. Of course, there were a few things here and there that didn’t go as expected, but they mean very little when I look at the bigger picture.

## My Travels

This year, I finally got to meet my teammates in person after my company gave me the opportunity to travel to Europe. It was an incredibly enriching experience, filled with great moments. Being able to work together in the same space—even for a short time—felt truly special. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that we’ll get to do it again in 2026.

I was also able to attend Do iOS 2025, my first international iOS conference, in Amsterdam, and it was an absolute blast. I learned a lot during the conference, and even though the long trip left me pretty tired, I still managed to enjoy the city, try new food, drink new beers, and experience so many new things. On top of that, I was lucky enough to win an extra ticket for my partner, which made the whole experience twice as special.

## My Year In Numbers

According to my GitHub stats, I managed to ship seven new releases for both Chroma and Amuse this year—honestly, I was expecting that number to be a bit higher 😅. I also released a new version of this website (which is what allows me to write this post) and shipped a couple of updates for my dev library, Caffeine.

I know these numbers aren’t particularly impressive, and believe me when I say my indie app sales numbers were pretty similar 🤣. But for me, it’s not really about chasing big numbers—it’s about doing what you truly love and continuing to enjoy the process.

## Final Thoughts

Sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough, or that everyone else who gives talks or builds apps is on a completely different level—one I’ll never be able to reach.
And yet, I often surprise myself when I look back at how much I’ve accomplished and how far I’ve come after all these years dedicated to app development. That realization gives me the motivation and energy to keep doing what I love.

Never let anyone tell you that you can’t achieve something—not even that little voice inside your head.

**Enjoy this new year, 2026!**

## Bonus Track

I won a Nintendo Switch 2 at my company’s end-of-year party—oh man, what a way to wrap things up!
